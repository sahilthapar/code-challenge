# Disclaimers

- All events are expected to have two properties at least
    - key
    - event_time

- Only completed weeks are considered for LTV calculation
    - 10 days is still 1 week
    - Customers who have been using the website for less than 1 week are
    considered to have insufficient data and have been assigned an LTV value of 0.

- Duplicate event handling based on event verbs
    - Duplicate customers are handled as are customer updates
    - Duplicate orders are handled as are order updates
    - Each site visit is considered to be a new visit
    - Each image upload is considered to be a new upload

- History of events is not maintained
    - Only latest customer info, order info is available
    - This can be easily changed by changing the implementation of datastore to append events
